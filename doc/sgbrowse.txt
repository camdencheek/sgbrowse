INTRODUCTION                                    *sgbrowse*

Whenever you are editing a file, and want to open it in Sourcegraph to browse
or share, run :SGBrowse

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *:SGBrowse*
:SGBrowse                Open the current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag
                        in your browser at the upstream hosting provider.
                        If a range is given, it is appropriately appended to
                        the URL as an anchor.

                        Upstream providers can be added by installing an
                        appropriate Vim plugin.  For example, GitHub can be
                        supported by installing rhubarb.vim, available at
                        <https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb>.

:SGBrowse {object}       Like :SGBrowse, but for a given |fugitive-object|.

:SGBrowse [...]@{remote} Force using the given remote rather than the remote
                        for the current branch.  The remote is used to
                        determine which upstream repository to link to.

:{range}SGBrowse [args]  Appends an anchor to the URL that emphasizes the
                        selected lines. This also forces the URL to include a
                        commit rather than a branch name so it remains valid
                        if the file changes.  You can give a range of "0" to
                        force this behavior without including an anchor.

:[range]SGBrowse! [args] Like :SGBrowse, but put the URL on the clipboard rather
                        than opening it.
